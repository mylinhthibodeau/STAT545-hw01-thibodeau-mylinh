# STAT545-hw01-thibodeau-mylinh

* Comment: I will be using this README.md file to track what I have learned in this homework. This is the first homework with GitHub and Markdown and I am looking forward to learning how to use these resources optimally. 
File opened locally on RStudio.

## A little history of Git, Github and My Linh 
### Once upon a time in a computer far far far away ...
> A student started to learn about two brothers with confusing names: Git and Github...

There is something I don't quite understand.

> ... but as the student didn't know the difference between the brothers, she met several challenges.

There was a conflict message when trying to committ the changes made in RStudio to Git.

> Luckily for the student, internet came to the rescue!

### Eventually, the student finally started the assignment.

I will use the topic of my research, hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes, to learn the diverse features of RMarkdown.

Here is a list of some high penetrance hereditary cancer genes:   
*BRCA1*  
*BRCA2*  
*TP53*  
*PTEN*  
*CDH1*  
*STK11*  
*MLH1*  
*MSH2*  
*MSH6*  
*PMS2*  
*MUTYH*  
*APC*  
*SMAD4*  
*BMPR1A*  

I found this list on the [Hereditary Cancer Program Panel website](http://www.ccgenomics.ca/available-tests.html)

### An example: Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC) syndrome

The importance of detecting germline mutations in hereditary cancer predisposition genes resides in the fact that the medical and/or surgical management of such individuals can be tailored to their cancer risk.

Considering triple negative breast cancer cases, the age of onset is much earlier in individuals with high penetrance hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, as illustrated by the image below (Couch et al. 2015)

Here is an example of R code inserted with Markdown:
```{r}
days_week <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday")
work_hours <- seq(40, 76, 6)
my_data <- data.frame(days_week, work_hours)
View(my_data)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
plot(my_data, type = "h")
```
